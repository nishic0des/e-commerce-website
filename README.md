# Simple E-Commerce

A lightweight and interactive e-commerce application that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout. The app uses **local storage** to persist the cart data, ensuring that the user's selections are saved even after refreshing the page.


## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products with their names and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Shopping Cart**: Displays the items in the cart, including the ability to remove items.
- **Checkout**: Allows users to checkout, clearing the cart and displaying a success message.
- **Persistent Cart**: Cart data is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across page refreshes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for adding/removing items, updating the cart, and persisting data.
